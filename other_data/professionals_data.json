He gave me many design ideas to choose. He also advised on whether the wants I proposed works for my unit or not. As I am on a tight budget, he made tweaks to the design so that I would still like the design but yet making it pocket friendly. He also helped bring me along on getting fittings, curtains, home appliances, furnitures etc. As some items are bought online, he offered that I can send it to his office or he helped received it at my house. Over the course of the last few months, he will check in to ask how is everything at home. He even came over to help tighten a loose screw in my cabinet! Really appreciate all the little help when the renovation has already long ended. Will definitely recommend him and his team to whoever needs a good makeover for their place.</span></p>",

Of course we met up with a couple of IDs and didn&rsquo;t take long to decide on Ashok because firstly, he was genuine and honest. Very prompt whenever we posed him any kind of questions and, very knowledgeable. Once the renovation started, he provided us with the progress every other day.

Before engaging Logan, we consulted a few other IDs, but they were not able to properly gauge the style that we were looking for and did not seem as genuine. After the first meeting with Logan, he came up with a few sample drawings and we were impressed by his art work and professionalism. Without a doubt, we went ahead and booked Logan&rsquo;s time.<br><br>Throughout the whole renovation process, Logan gave many creative ideas and genuine advices. He was always responsive when we had questions, and always attended to us very quickly. When the renovation was completed, the work was beyond our expectations, it was very refined and neatly done. We have received many compliments from our friends and family.<br><br>If we had to go through the process again, we will pick Logan as our ID, definitely.

    "shortDesc": "Wolf Woof is a multifaceted design studio that believes that every home should be as unique as its owners. We believe in creating bespoke homes that infuse unique, personal touches while ensuring functionality and liveability. We believe in creating stories that reflect the homeowners’ taste and preferences. We believe in taking an unconventional approach to designing dream homes and rising above mediocrity because no one deserves a cookie-cutter home.\n\nWolf Woof’s winning formula? Our ability to craft one-of-its-kind bespoke homes that are not only good-looking but jam packed with unique features and at the same time ooze character and charm. Because of founder Carmen’s strong marketing and graphic design background, the firm’s approach to interior design is the so-far-out-of-the-box-you-cannot-even-see-the-box approach. \n\nWolf Woof’s competitive edge? Creativity (to bring homeowners to places where they would otherwise not have gone on the reno journey, to not think like a typical Interior Designer). Versatility (to execute different styles with equal ease). Wow factor (not all wow factors involve over-the-top features but must capture the essence of homeowners and yes, evoke that ‘PIK POK PIK POK’ feel – if a design doesn’t make your heart skip a beat, it has not done its job)\n\nWolf Woof’s design philosophy? BE ANYTHING BUT MEDIOCRE. In general, mediocrity and herd mentality puts us off. Wolf Woof’s other design philosophy is – YOUR HOME, YOUR RULES… because no one can/should dictate how your home should look. You decide how your home should reflect who you are, it’s the designer’s job to ensure that the eventual idea is unique, exciting and befitting.  \n\nWolf Woof is not married to any particular design style. We believe STRONGLY that good designers should be able to execute ANY DESIGN STYLE, from the commonly-requested Scandinavian style, to Hamptons chic, to Regal and Debonair, to Minimalist, to fun and quirky etc. Because it’s not hard to be good at doing just ONE thing (style) day in and out, it takes a lot more to be able to interpret a plethora of very diverse styles.",

We engaged Eric from Corazon Interior for the renovation of my BTO 4-room flat. Our main factor that for choosing Eric was that the quality and workmanship of the houses he have done were superb. From start to end, Eric was not only very responsive over WhatsApp/Phone call, he was also incredibly responsible. Eric goes all the way to make sure any imperfection (no matter how small) is solved the moment you point it out. Even though the price might be higher as compared to other ID firms, the quality/workmanship and the responsibility of Eric is really worth every penny. Bear in mind that we are quite OCD when it comes to quality.Huge shoutout to Eric from Corazon Interior. Thank you for everything.</span></p>",

He was always responsive, patient, and had a great attitude throughout the whole process. I really appreciated how he promptly addressed issues we pointed out and made sure things were rectified.<br><br>While there were some challenges with the workmanship of the contractors (some tasks needed to be redone), Daz took responsibility and followed through to ensure things were fixed properly. Overall, we are happy with his service and dedication, and could see he genuinely cared when delivering a good outcome for the clients. Would recommend him for his professionalism and commitment!! Thank you Daz :)</span></p>",

Super responsive and easy to talk to, and he understood the kind of style and feel we wanted for our home. Gave us practical and realistic ideas instead of over-the-top suggestions, which we really appreciated. Overall, the process was smooth and stress-free, and we&rsquo;re really happy with how everything turned out. ☺️</span></p>",
