Once Upon A Toy,Alliance Française de Singapour,Step into a world where toys become storytellers.,"Step into a world where toys become storytellers of childhood dreams with Alliance Francaise and MINT Museum of Toys ' new exhibition, Imaginaire: Of Small Memories and Greater Dreams . Join a captivating exhibition that invites visitors to rediscover the world of French childhood through the toys that shaped it across the 20th century. In collaboration with the MINT Museum of Toys, this unique exhibition offers a chronological exploration of how toys reflect the shifting hopes, values, and fantasies of growing up in a changing world. From intricate mechanical creations of the early 1900s to mass-produced plastic icons of the post-war boom, IMAGINAIRE showcases how imagination, innovation, and marketing together transformed toys into powerful vessels of identity, escapism, and creativity. The exhibition is structured around three evolving themes that define the way children dream: Escape from reality : toys that transport children to faraway lands, magical circuses, or even outer space Connection and companionship : plush animals, dolls, and board games that reflect the emotional and social world of play Becoming your own hero : objects that let children see themselves as stars, explorers, or champions of their own story More than just a nostalgic journey, IMAGINAIRE is a cultural reflection on how play helps shape who we are as individuals and societies.",https://alliancefrancaise.org.sg/events/imaginaire-of-small-memories-and-greater-dreams-2025-10-11-2025-12-13-5197/register#/,activity,https://alliancefrancaise.org.sg/events/imaginaire-of-small-memories-and-greater-dreams-2025-10-11-2025-12-13-5197/register#/,True,Free,Free,0.0,0.0,0,5 years old and above,5.0,99.0,11 Oct - 13 Dec,"Weekdays (except Mon): 1pm - 7.30pm, Sat: 9am - 6pm",2025-10-11T01:00:00,2025-12-13T19:30:00,Alliance Française de Singapour,,"French, culture, toys, exhibition, museum","1 Sarkies Rd, Singapore 258130",Attraction,"[{""url"": ""https://alliancefrancaise.org.sg/web/image/565441/A4Portrait-KVImaginaire-vF.jpg?access_token=2fa08f50-b0ab-424a-8c80-86fece4b7162"", ""original_url"": ""https://alliancefrancaise.org.sg/web/image/565441/A4Portrait-KVImaginaire-vF.jpg?access_token=2fa08f50-b0ab-424a-8c80-86fece4b7162"", ""filename"": ""Once_Upon_A_Toy_1.jpg"", ""local_path"": ""events_output/attraction_add/images/Once_Upon_A_Toy_1.jpg"", ""source_credit"": ""Alliance Française de Singapour""}]",863.0,103.837075,1.3140889,Newton,Central Region,True,alliancefrancaise.json

A Whale of a Tale at National Museum,CTArt,Customised playground inspired by blue whale skeleton.,"A Whale of a Tale is a customised playground inspired by the iconic blue whale skeleton once displayed at the National Museum of Singapore. This installation was built in collaboration with SPACELogic, blending artistry, storytelling, and safe play design into a remarkable interactive experience. The majestic Whale Structure, crafted from Glass Fibre Reinforced Concrete (GFRC) and equipped with a wide variety of play equipment that encourages exploration, imagination, and physical activity. Children can tunnel through the underside of the whale’s head or climb up using ladders, scale across the cargo net blowhole, and descend the slide that exits through the whale’s mouth. Mosaic tiles embellish the whale’s head and tail, while climbing grips—designed to resemble barnacles—offer tactile and visual appeal. Behind the head, interactive Galopin play panels and a steering wheel ignite imaginative adventures. The skeletal body of the whale offers additional fun elements such as swing seats, a spring seat, and a cargo net, promoting balance and coordination. Between the whale’s body and tail, children can navigate a series of balance beams and play mounds that test their agility. Music and movement intertwine through Percussion Play instruments, where children can experiment with rhythm by spinning the Cyclone—mimicking the gentle sound of rain—or striking the Djembe to produce varying tones. The Berliner Disk, tilted for dynamic spinning, enhances coordination and spatial awareness as children learn to balance through motion.
