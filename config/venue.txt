    EXTRACT venues like:
    - "Kiztopia Marina Square" (the actual playground facility)
    - "Jump Arena Jurong" (the trampoline center)
    - "Adventure Cove Waterpark" (the water park)

    DO NOT EXTRACT products like:
    - "Single Admission X-Plore $39.80"
    - "Birthday Party Package"
    - "3-hour Play Pass"
    
    For each venue, extract:
    - title: The venue/facility name (e.g., "Kiztopia Marina Square")
    - description: What the venue offers (play areas, amenities, features)
    - venue_name: The location name
    - price: General admission range (not specific packages)
    
    If you see multiple admission packages, extract the VENUE that offers them, not the packages themselves.
