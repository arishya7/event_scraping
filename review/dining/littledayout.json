The salted egg pasta features prawns. The Double Trouble Burger has succulent patties. There is a kids menu available. A key feature is the indoor play area with a slide resembling the Toa Payoh Dragon Playground, providing a safe environment for children while parents dine. Expect to spend between $15 to $25 per head. The bistro exudes a sense of calmness away from the city environment.",
