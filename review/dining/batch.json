    "description": "Honest to goodness, it is our commitment to quality and artisanality in everything we offer to you and your little ones. Comfortable classics don't need to be overprocessed, think in-house sourdough, fresh pasta, and bakes. As we continually gain inspiration from what’s grown around us, escape from the hustle and bustle to a space that feels like a haven rather than an interruption to the iconic gardens.",
