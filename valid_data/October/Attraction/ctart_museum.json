    "description": "A Whale of a Tale is a customised playground inspired by the iconic blue whale skeleton once displayed at the National Museum of Singapore. This installation was built in collaboration with SPACELogic, blending artistry, storytelling, and safe play design into a remarkable interactive experience. The majestic Whale Structure, crafted from Glass Fibre Reinforced Concrete (GFRC) and equipped with a wide variety of play equipment that encourages exploration, imagination, and physical activity. Children can tunnel through the underside of the whale’s head or climb up using ladders, scale across the cargo net blowhole, and descend the slide that exits through the whale’s mouth. Mosaic tiles embellish the whale’s head and tail, while climbing grips—designed to resemble barnacles—offer tactile and visual appeal. Behind the head, interactive Galopin play panels and a steering wheel ignite imaginative adventures. The skeletal body of the whale offers additional fun elements such as swing seats, a spring seat, and a cargo net, promoting balance and coordination. Between the whale’s body and tail, children can navigate a series of balance beams and play mounds that test their agility. Music and movement intertwine through Percussion Play instruments, where children can experiment with rhythm by spinning the Cyclone—mimicking the gentle sound of rain—or striking the Djembe to produce varying tones. The Berliner Disk, tilted for dynamic spinning, enhances coordination and spatial awareness as children learn to balance through motion. Surrounding Outerspace outdoor picnic furniture set provides a welcoming area for rest and social connection.",
