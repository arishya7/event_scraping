    "description": "Step into a world where toys become storytellers of childhood dreams with Alliance Francaise and MINT Museum of Toys ' new exhibition, Imaginaire: Of Small Memories and Greater Dreams . Join a captivating exhibition that invites visitors to rediscover the world of French childhood through the toys that shaped it across the 20th century. In collaboration with the MINT Museum of Toys, this unique exhibition offers a chronological exploration of how toys reflect the shifting hopes, values, and fantasies of growing up in a changing world. From intricate mechanical creations of the early 1900s to mass-produced plastic icons of the post-war boom, IMAGINAIRE showcases how imagination, innovation, and marketing together transformed toys into powerful vessels of identity, escapism, and creativity. The exhibition is structured around three evolving themes that define the way children dream: Escape from reality : toys that transport children to faraway lands, magical circuses, or even outer space Connection and companionship : plush animals, dolls, and board games that reflect the emotional and social world of play Becoming your own hero : objects that let children see themselves as stars, explorers, or champions of their own story More than just a nostalgic journey, IMAGINAIRE is a cultural reflection on how play helps shape who we are as individuals and societies.",
