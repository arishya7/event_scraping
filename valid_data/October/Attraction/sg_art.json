It has since become an important hub for contemporary art experiments and exhibitions. Chen Sai Hua Kuan's 'Space Drawing 14' transforms the gallery into a canvas, using a single continuous bungee rope as a line to create a path that traverses and intersects the gallery. Han Sai Por addresses environmental degradation, such as deforestation and the loss of jungle and animal habitats across Southeast Asia. Her intense engagement with nature stems from her lifelong concern for these pressing issues, offering powerful commentary on our evolving relationship with the natural world.",
