    "description": "Sea Shell Park is a vibrant marine-themed playground designed to bring waves of fun and imagination to Pasir Ris. Developed as part of the \"Build A Playground\" initiative, the park was created through the Pasir Ris community's participation. Students contributed by choosing the ethylene propylene diene monomer ( EPDM) flooring design, adding a personal and youthful touch to the space. In the middle of the playground is the Miracle Mega Tower, soaring two storeys above ground with slides at each deck. Children can climb to the top through several exciting routes, such as an Arch Climber, Vertical Climber, Net Climber, and a Diagonal Climbing Ladder shaped like a ship’s sail. Its flowing jellyfish-inspired contours capture the essence of the sea and invite children to immerse themselves in imaginative play while developing strength and coordination. Beside it lies the Sea Dragon structure supplied by Kiwi, a playful and dynamic feature that stretches across the playground. Children can climb, crawl and balance along its undulating body, each section offering unique play opportunities through bridges, slides, and climbing holds. Beneath the dragon’s head is a hidden tunnel waiting to be discovered, sparking curiosity and problem-solving. The entire structure encourages storytelling, creativity and a sense of adventure while nurturing motor skills and confidence. The surrounding play area includes thoughtfully designed elements that echo the coastal theme of Pasir Ris. A cluster of poles and Butterfly Steppers inspired by sea anemones and reef-like steppers promotes agility and imaginative movement. The Cozy Cocoon offers a quiet retreat, while the Standing See-Saw, Merry-Go-Round and Multi-Seat Rocker bring children together through laughter and shared play. Younger ones enjoy interactive play panels that engage their senses through touch and sound. Beyond play, the park also features OmniGym and LifeTrail fitness equipment, offering a safe and comprehensive outdoor fitness experience. Adjustable-weight machines for pull muscle group strength training deliver gym-quality workouts, while bodyweight stations for push-ups, pull-ups, and dips cater to different strength levels. By combining safety, fitness and fun, Sea Shell Park stands as a shining example of modern playground design that celebrates community involvement. The combination of inclusive play and fitness spaces creates an environment where families can stay active, connected and healthy together.",
