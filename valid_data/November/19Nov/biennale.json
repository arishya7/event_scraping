Joy: It is a warm feeling that sits deep in our hearts and bubbles up when we delight in something that is meaningful and special to us. Kindness: Being friendly and polite, caring and considerate to others can help them feel safe, valued and included. Don’t forget to be kind to yourself too. Do things that make you happy. Love: It is a feeling that makes us feel happy, valued and safe. We receive love and we also give love. Dream: Imagination fuels art, and what you dream today can shape a kind, inclusive, diverse world.",
