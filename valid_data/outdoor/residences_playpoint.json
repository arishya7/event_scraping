    "description": "Public housing blocks boast spaces for residents of all ages and walks of life. When designing playgrounds and public furnishings, we’ve drawn inspiration from history, culture and the environment. From the military-themed play areas of Choa Chu Kang to the nature-flavoured grasshopper slides at Seng Kang, we pay tribute to local icons and sights. Our playgrounds offer inclusive play equipment, catering to children of different abilities. We also provide fitness corners and outdoor furniture to promote active living and social interaction among residents. These spaces encourage community bonding and enhance the overall well-being of the neighbourhood.",
