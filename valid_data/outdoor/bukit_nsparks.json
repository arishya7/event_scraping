    "description": "The Jacob Ballas Children’s Garden is the first garden in Asia dedicated to children, designed for those aged 14 and below. It aims to educate and instil a love for nature. The garden is a complete nature-learning environment, where children can delve deeper into the ecology of plants and our environment through discovery and experiential learning. The Garden offers exploration, adventure and play, with a farm, an orchard, and a forest with its own stream and ponds. Young adventure seekers can explore the suspension bridge and nature play areas; budding naturalists can walk along the stream and climb into the tree-houses; and urban gardeners can observe how plants grow and pick up some gardening tips!",
