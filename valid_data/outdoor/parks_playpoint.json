    "description": "Our playgrounds are inspired by the environment, the trees, insects, flowers and fields all around us. And our installations serve to enhance the beauty of nature. We’ve decorated Gardens by the Bay with wooden Riva benches, and brought outdoor gyms to kids at Yishun Nature Park. Our Origami playground sculpture in Malaysia is an inspired creation, and our playground at West Coast Park is a favourite amongst families.",
