    "description": "Bee’s Knees is a fun, laid-back cafe & bistro concept that draws inspiration from the highly social, evolved behaviour of bees. The first Bee’s Knees opened in 2017 at The Garage, Singapore Botanic Gardens, fast becoming a hot spot for the simplest most joyous occasions in our lives: pet owners to chill with their furkids al fresco, parents to dine in peace while their little ones totter about, and a cozy respite for social get-togethers. Dig in to comfort food elevated to be hearty and satisfying with South East Asian touches. With a wholesome and diverse menu with vegetarian options, the little ones, the health-conscious, the indulgent, and the alcoholic all get something under one hive.",
